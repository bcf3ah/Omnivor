# Omnivor
I plan to make this a social network for reaching across the aisle, a way for people to hear different points of view. I don't have the skills to finish it yet, but I hope to make it a reality soon. If you'd like to contribute, feel free! I want this to be as open as possible to fit with the theme of honest communication, something our society most certainly needs right now.

# Tasks
GraphQL subscriptions for real-time dialogues
OAuth
User profiles
Reddit-like threads
Jigsaw spam filters
Mediated chatrooms (no small feat, I know)

# Stack
Front end - React/Redux, Apollo Client, MaterializeCSS
Back end - NodeJS/Express, GraphQL-Express, GraphQL-Tools, MongoDB/Mongoose, Passport with JWTs for auth

*Notes - front end proxies requests to port 4000 back end; need to set own mongoDB instance to process.env.MONGO
